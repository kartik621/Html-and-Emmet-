    <h1>Self-Closing Tags</h1>
    <p>Self-closing tags, also known as void elements or empty elements, are <br>
         HTML tags that do not require a closing tag. They represent elements <br>
          that do not contain any content or children. Instead of using a <br>
          separate closing tag, self-closing tags are written with a forward <br>
           slash at the end of the opening <br>

        Examples of self-closing tags in HTML include: <br>
        
        <br>: Line break tag
        <img>: Image tag
        <input>: Input field tag
        <meta>: Meta information tag</p>

        <h2>Meta Tags</h2>
        <p>Meta tags are special HTML tags used to provide metadata or <br>
            additional information about an HTML document. They are placed <br>
             within the <head> section of an HTML document and are not visible <br>
            to website visitors. Meta tags provide information to browsers, <br>
            search engines, and other web services about the webpage's content, <br>
            encoding, authorship, keywords, and more.</p>

            <meta name="description" content="This is the description of my webpage.">
